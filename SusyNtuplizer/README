1. How to set up and run the ntuplizer
#################################################################################################

This section mainly concerns the production of the ntuples. If you intend to only use a pre-made
ntuples dataset, you can directly skip to section 2 (Although following 1.1 is an easy way to have
all the environments set up even in this case).

1.1 Setup ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. Create a release workspace and checkout the required packages
setenv SCRAM_ARCH slc5_amd64_gcc462
cmsrel CMSSW_5_3_8_patch3
cd CMSSW_5_3_8_patch3/src
cmsenv

b. Edit files that cause too many printouts

RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/src/EGEnergyCorrector.cc Line 562-565: delete
EGamma/EGammaAnalysisTools/plugins/ElectronIdMVAProducer.cc Line 72: insert "TMVA::MsgLogger::InhibitOutput();"

c. Compile

scram b -j8

1.2 Running the ntuplizer -----------------------------------------------------------------------

File runOverAOD.py is the standard CMSSW job configuration to produce the SUSY ntuples. For
most purposes the user only needs to modify the first two blocks (dataset name and source name).
The list of possible dataset names is given right below the blocks.

1.3 NoPU / MVA MET ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two new MET algorithms were developed by the JetMET group in late 2012. These are not yet part
of CMSSW, and requires several additional packages to run. By default, the new METs are not included
in the standard ntuplizer configuration. Follow the instructions below to run the new algorithms.

a. Check out the following packages

cvs co -r b5_3_X_cvMEtCorr_2013Feb22  DataFormats/METReco
# The package below depends on DataFormats/METReco, and requires a recompile
cvs co -r CMSSW_5_3_8_patch3          CommonTools/RecoAlgos
cvs co -r V03-04-07                   RecoMET/METAlgorithms
cvs co -r METPU_5_3_X_v4              JetMETCorrections/METPUSubtraction
cvs co -r METPU_5_3_X_v4              RecoJets/JetProducers/data/TMVAClassificationCategory_JetID_MET_53X_Dec2012.weights.xml
cvs co -r V00-03-34                   PhysicsTools/SelectorUtils
cvs co -r HEAD -d pharrisTmp          UserCode/pharris/MVAMet/data
cp  -d pharrisTmp/*Dec2012*.root JetMETCorrections/METPUSubtraction/data/
rm -rf pharrisTmp

b. Then, before compiling, edit the file JetMETCorrections/METPUSubtraction/plugin/NoPileUpPFMEtDataProducer.cc

Replace line 17
#include "RecoMET/METAlgorithms/interface/SigInputObj.h"    //PH: preserve 5_3_x dependence
with
#include "DataFormats/METReco/interface/SigInputObj.h"

c. Compile the workspace.

d. In runOverAOD.py, search for a boolean flag runNoPUMVAMetSequence and set it to True.

2. How to use the ntuples
#################################################################################################

2.1 Sample macro --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sample analysis macro exists in the macro directory. When using with CMSSW (have gone through the
steps in 1.1), this should work out-of-the-box by

cd macro
(copy susyEvents.root over to the directory)
root -b -q ana.C

If instead one wishes to work without the CMSSW framework, the library has to be compiled before
running the analysis:

############## TODO change this line once we have a tag for the new release ###########
cvs co -d SusyNtuplizer -r HEAD UserCode/LPCPJM/SusyAnalysis/SusyNtuplizer
cd SusyNtuplizer/macro
make
root -b -q ana.C

ana.C links the library and compiles the two analysis codes, SusyEventAnalyzer.cc and SusyEventPrinter.cc.
The Printer file contains the utility functions to print out the content of the event. The
Analyzer file is the analysis skeleton. The user is invited to modify the content of the Run()
function to fit his/her analysis needs.

2.2 Opening the file in bare ROOT environment ---------------------------------------------------

SUSY ntuples files contain vectors of objects that are defined in src/SusyEvent.h and requires to
link a library for ROOT to understand their contents. To link the library, do

root[0] gSystem->Load("libSusyEvent.so")

If using ROOT from a CMSSW environment (after issuing cmsenv), or

root[0] gSystem->Load("full_path_to_macro_directory/libSusyEvent.so")

if using ROOT independent of CMSSW (after following 2.1).
The above function can be included in the user's rootlogon.C file to have the library linked
automatically whenever ROOT is started.

2.3 susyTree content ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is one object in the file, which is a TTree named susyTree. The branches of the tree represent
event-level information such as run number and event number, collections of generic objects such as
vertices and tracks, and the collections of physics objects. Since there can be multiple physics
object collections of the same type (e.g. corrected and uncorrected MET (not a collection but a single
object in this case)), the branches of physics objects are follow the naming convention of "type_label",
such as met_pfMet or met_pfType1CorrectedMet.

2.4 Parsing the tree with an Event object -------------------------------------------------------

* The following works both in compiled and interactive environments.

* THIS SECTION IS VERY IMPORTANT!! READ CAREFULLY!!

The Event object defined in src/SusyEvent.h acts as a container of all information that is in an
entry of the susyTree.
To instatiate an event, do

susy::Event* event = new susy::Event;

then pass the TTree object to it:

TTree* susyTree;
inputFile->GetObject("susyTree", susyTree);
event->setInput(*susyTree);

To fill the event object content with the data from the input tree, *Event::getEntry function* is
used instead of TTree::GetEntry.

event->getEntry(entry_number);

Using susyTree->GetEntry(entry_number) will not update the trigger results and will cause
inconsistencies.

At the end of the analysis code, the Event object must be deleted before the TTree is deleted:

delete event;
delete susyTree;

2.5 Copying / writing the tree ------------------------------------------------------------------

It is also highly recommended to let the Event object take care of copying the susyTree. While a
traditional method such as

TTree* myCopy = susyTree->CloneTree(0);

will work when copying events from a single tree, for cases where susyTree is a TChain (e.g. when
making a skim out of a large collection of files) this can fail at the trigger menu transition.
The recommended method is to "add" the tree to the event:

TFile* outputFile = TFile::Open("output.root", "recreate");
TTree* myCopy = new TTree;
event->addOutput(*myCopy);

while(event->getEntry(iEntry++) >= 0){
  // make event selections..
  myCopy->Fill();
}

event->releaseTree(*myCopy); // This has to be done before the output tree is deleted

outputFile->cd();
myCopy->Write();
delete outputFile; // Deletes the tree as well

As the name of the function suggests, users can create more than one output from a single source.

3. Other important information
#################################################################################################

3.1 Accessing physics objects in the Event ------------------------------------------------------

As explained in 2.3, susyTree can contain multiple collections of the same type with different
labels. These "collections of collections" are represented in the Event object using a std::map
from TString to the collection, where the string is the object label. See macro/SusyEventAnalyzer.cc
for an example of how to access the collections.

3.2 Accessing the trigger results ---------------------------------------------------------------

hltMap and l1Map members of the Event holds the trigger prescales and results, which can be retrieved
by the functions prescale(TString) and pass(TString) respectively. The string argument of the
functions are the trigger path names, which is required to be either exact or a wildcard expression.
The only allowed wildcard character is the *, which can be used in place of a string of any length,
and it has to come at the end of the path name.

Note that CMS HLT path names always end with the version number that can be different among the run
periods. Therefore, to require the results of all triggers of e.g. Photon36_Photon22, one has to
append "_v*" to the path name.

3.3 MET filters ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The list of MET filters is given as an enum at the beginning of the file src/SusyEvent.h. All filter
results are stored in the SUSY ntuples as single bits in an integer metFilterBit, with the bit
positions given by the enum above. Explanation for some of the filters are given below. Information
on the rest of the filters should be available in JetMET twiki MissingETOptionalFilters.

The Event object has two functions related to the MET filters: Event::passMetFilter(unsigned int)
and Event::passMetFilters(). The former returns the individual met filter results by taking the bit
number as the argument (e.g. event->passMetFilter(susy::kCSCBeamHalo)), while the latter returns the
combined result of several MET filters. The combination is defined by the bit mask Event::metFilterMask,
which should be configured to an appropriate combination for the dataset and run period being analyzed.
An example of bit mask configuration is given in macro/SusyEventAnalyzer.cc.

The function return value of true indicates that the event passes the filter, i.e. has no problem of
the specific sort.

HcalLaser filter

There are three filters related to HCAL laser contamination. HcalLaserOccupancy bit stores the filter
result obtained by running a rechit occupancy-based tagger (RecoMET.METFilters.hcalLaserEventFilter_cfi).
HcalLaserEventList bit comes from the event list at EventFilter/HcalRawToDigi/data/HCALLaser2012AllDatasets.txt.gz
which is provided by the PdmV and covers 2012 A+B+C prompt datasets. HcalLaserRECOUserStep bit is
only available for 22Jan2013 rereco or newer datasets, and contains the result of laser contamination
tagging done at the central RECO stage.

Tracking POG filter

Filter bits ManyStripClus53X, TooManyStripClus53X, LogErrorTooManyClusters, LogErrorTooManyTripletsPairs,
and LogErrorTooManySeeds are all grouped as "Tracking POG filter". The first two uses the information
stored in clusterSummary, which is a part of AOD from 53X, while the latter three uses the LogError
information from RECO step, also saved in AOD. The latter three are the default recommended Tracking
POG filter (as of May 2013).

3.4 Jet energy correction and detailed scales and uncertainties ---------------------------------

The jet objects in susyTree contain L1L2L3 correction, L2L3 correction, and the unceratinty on L1L2L3
correction. They are stored as a map from a string to the scale factor. The available corrections
are:

PFJet:
 - "L2L3"
 - "L1FastL2L3"
CaloJet:
 - "L2L3"
 - "L1L2L3"
JPTJet:
 - "L2L3"
 - "L1L2L3"

In all cases, the residual correction is included for jets in real data.

* The following works only in a CMSSW environment.

If the user wishes to know what the individual correction factor/uncertainty is,the following
steps has to be followed. The sample macro of 2.1 is used as an example.

a. Modify jec/jec.py to use the correct global tag and run the job. From the output of the job,
find the file named "XYZ_L2L3Residual_ABC.txt" in the directory and rename it to
"XYZ_L2RelativeL3AbsoluteResidual_ABC.txt". This is the file containing residual corrections used
for collision data.

b. Add the following lines at the beggining of ana.C

gSystem->AddIncludePath("-I" + TString(gSystem->Getenv("CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE")) + "/src");
gSystem->Load("libCondFormatsJetMETObjects.so");

c. In SusyEventAnalyzer.cc, include the necessary headers

#include "CondFormats/JetMETObjects/interface/FactorizedJetCorrector.h" // to access the JEC scales
#include "CondFormats/JetMETObjects/interface/JetCorrectionUncertainty.h" // to access the uncertainties

d. In Run(), instantiate the correction objects before the event loop

std::string jecDir("full_path_to_jec_directory");
// For the scales (applying L123Residual correction to collision data)
FactorizedJetCorrector jec("L1FastJet:L2Relative:L3Absolute:L2Relative",
                           jecDir + "/XYZ_L1FastJet_ABC.txt:" +
                           jecDir + "/XYZ_L2Relative_ABC.txt:" +
                           jecDir + "/XYZ_L3Absolute_ABC.txt:" +
                           jecDir + "/XYZ_L2RelativeL3AbsoluteResidual_ABC.txt");

// For the uncertainties
JetCorrectionUnceratinty jecUncert(fullPathBase + "/name_of_uncertainty_file");

The first argument of the FactorizedJetCorrector constructor must be some colon-concatenation of the
following strings: L1Offset, L1JPTOffset, L2Relative, L3Absolute, L4EMF, L5Flavor, L6SLB, L7Parton,
L1FastJet. The second argument must give the colon-concatenated list of parameter files in the
corresponding order.
The last correction name in the example above is L2Relative, although the content of the correction
is residual. This is a workaround hack needed because the module does not understand the correction
name L2L3Residual. The way the L2 and the residual corrections are applied are identical, so the end
result will be correct.

e. In the jet loop, use the objects

jec.setJetEta(jet.momentum.Eta());
jec.setJetPt(jet.momentum.Pt());
jec.setJetA(jet.jetArea); // when using L1FastJet
jec.setRho(event->rho); // when using L1FastJet; choose your rho flavor
float scale = jec.getCorrection();

jecUncert.setJetEta(jet.momentum.Eta());
jecUncert.setJetPt(jet.momentum.Pt() * scale);
float uncertainty = jecUncert.getUncertainty(true);

To make a standalone Jet corrections,

$ cmsRun jec.py

This will create JEC lookup tables as text files.

cvs co -d JetMETObjects CMSSW/CondFormats/JetMETObjects

Check out the latest JetMETObjects from the CVS. Some modifications are needed because some files use cms::Exception and typelookup. I just simply commented. Then,

$ cd JetMETObjects
$ make

This will create a shared library in ../lib/libJetMETObjects.so
You can include it in root macro.
Enjoy!
